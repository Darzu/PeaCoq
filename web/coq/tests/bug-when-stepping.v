Theorem plus_id_example : forall n m:nat,
  n = m -> 
  n + n = m + m.

(** Instead of making a completely universal claim about all numbers
    [n] and [m], this theorem talks about a more specialized property
    that only holds when [n = m].  The arrow symbol is pronounced
    "implies."

    As before, we need to be able to reason by assuming the existence
    of some numbers [n] and [m].  We also need to assume the hypothesis
    [n = m]. The [intros] tactic will serve to move all three of these
    from the goal into assumptions in the current context. 

    Since [n] and [m] are arbitrary numbers, we can't just use
    simplification to prove this theorem.  Instead, we prove it by
    observing that, if we are assuming [n = m], then we can replace
    [n] with [m] in the goal statement and obtain an equality with the
    same expression on both sides.  The tactic that tells Coq to
    perform this replacement is called [rewrite]. *)

Proof.
  intros n m.   (* move both quantifiers into the context *)
  intros H.     (* move the hypothesis into the context *)
  rewrite -> H. (* Rewrite the goal using the hypothesis *)
  reflexivity.  Qed.
